Ruby implementation of Tom Kerrigan's Simple Chess Program (TSCP), called RbTSCP. This first implementation was made *just to work*, however, it's ELO is about 1370, it can win newbies or median players.
The tests/"usage" are on the end of the RbTSCP.rb file.

Would like to thank my friend Ginaldo/Shiroyasha for the moral support on the period that I was rewriting from C sources to Ruby and for the pratical support on measuring ELO.
